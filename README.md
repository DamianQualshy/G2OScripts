# G2OScripts
A bunch of scripts and gamemodes I made on Gothic 2 Online, the multiplayer platform for Gothic 2: Night of the Raven.

To navigate between the files, choose a desired branch on top and proceed from there.

# Gothic Homecoming
The gamemode is based on how the 2011's Gothic Multiplayer worked, where you join a server and choose a class. That's it.
This is a different version of the script that should be uploaded, so when I find the time I rewrite it to what it's supposed to be.

Features:
- Class choice on join
- Animation window
- Player Visual change
- Global chat for everyone
