# G2OScripts
A bunch of scripts and gamemodes I made on Gothic 2 Online, the multiplayer platform for Gothic 2: Night of the Raven.

To navigate between the files, choose a desired branch on top and proceed from there.

# Counter-Strike
It's based on the old LUA gamemode, but not a straight-up port.

Features:
- Two teams (Guards and Bandits) alongside a Spectator
- Bomb plant/defuse
- Round time-limit
- Autobalance
- Consistent damage of 10
- Limiting players to only using crossbows
