# G2OScripts
A bunch of scripts and gamemodes I made on Gothic 2 Online, the multiplayer platform for Gothic 2: Night of the Raven.

To navigate between the files, choose a desired branch on top and proceed from there.

# EventLog
I don't really know why you're supposed to use it. The purpose of this is to print and save-to-file event results.
Which you can already do on your own, and probably better suited to your own script.
